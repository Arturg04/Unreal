# Getting Started

This guide will walk you through the setup process for Unreal Engine development and how to integrate the Health Component into your project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
- A computer that meets the [Unreal Engine system requirements](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/tech-specs).
- An Epic Games account.

## Steps

### 1. Install Unreal Engine

1. Download and install the Epic Games Launcher from [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com).
2. Open the Epic Games Launcher and sign in with your Epic Games account.
3. Navigate to the Unreal Engine tab and click the "Install Engine" button.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

### 2. Project Setup

1. Open the Epic Games Launcher and go to the Unreal Engine tab.
2. Click on the "Launch" button to open Unreal Engine.
3. Create a new project or open your existing one:
   - To create a new project, select a template (e.g., First Person, Third Person) and configure the project settings.
   - To open an existing project, click on the "Browse" button and select your project file.

### 3. Add Plugins

1. In the Unreal Engine editor, go to `Edit` > `Plugins`.
2. Search for the required plugins (e.g., Health System) and enable them.
3. Restart the Unreal Engine editor to apply the changes.

### 4. Blueprint vs. C++

Decide whether to use Blueprints, C++, or a combination of both for your project:
- **Blueprints**: Visual scripting system that is easier for beginners and faster for prototyping.
- **C++**: Provides more control and performance, suitable for complex systems and experienced developers.
- **Combination**: Use Blueprints for high-level logic and C++ for performance-critical or complex tasks.

### 5. Test Your Setup

Compile your project and ensure there are no errors.
